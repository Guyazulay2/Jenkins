>> If you run a job and it writes permission denied 
you need to modify the permission for jenkins user that you can run the shell commands

Go to : sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/jenkins

Find this $JENKINS_USER and change to "root"
like this [ $JENKINS_USER="root" ]

Then change the ownership of Jenkins home, webroot and logs
do that :
chown -R root:root /var/lib/jenkins
chown -R root:root /var/cache/jenkins
chown -R root:root /var/log/jenkins

Now start jenkins : [ service jenkins restart ] and thats all

If you run a job on slave and its says "Permission Denied, are you root? "
Try that : 
[ sudo nano /etc/sudousers ]

At the end of the file add :[ Jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL ]
Save and exit.

Then on your jenkins page, go to your job->configure->build triggers->build periodically
and add sudo in front of your compile statement
